	    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
	    <p>This project explores the concept of time-series forecasting and how it can be used to effectively predict trends for future data based on existing data. To show this, I decided to use data based on a topic that I am passionate about, which is the lack of a presence of some European soccer leagues in the United States. At the end, I use the forecasts to argue which leagues should try to increase their influence in the United States both for economic and popularity gain.</p>

	    <h2>Objectives and Methodologies</h2>
	    <p>The objective of this project was to accurately provide forecasts of the search volume statistics for each league. To obtain existing data to base this off of, I used Goggle Trends. I decided to a five-year period to account for the popularities both before and after COVID to try and provide a general prediction. Although many time-series forecasting methods are available, I decided to use the SARIMAX method to effectively account for the seasonality of the data, which occurs due to each league having a two to three month offseason. I also used grid search to obtain the best possible combination of parameters for the model. Various other Python extensions used were Pandas and Matplotlib for simple data wrangling and visualization. </p>
